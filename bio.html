	<h1>Bio</h1>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>am a senior studying Technical Communication at Eastern Washington University. As a technical communicator, I work with design software on a daily basis, including Adobe Suite and Microsoft Office, and am well versed in effective document design. I have worked at Eastern Washingtonâ€™s University Office of Global Initiatives for the past 3 three years. My work at the Office of Global Initiatives has given me the opportunity to interact with people of different cultures, increasing my multicultural competency. I am proficient in Japanese and studied abroad in Japan last year. Upon graduating from EWU, I will seek employment as a technical writer or an immigration adviser.  </p>
