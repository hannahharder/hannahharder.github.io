    <h3>Hi there!</h3>
    <p>I am from the beautiful city of Spokane, Washington and have lived here my whole life. I am engaged to my amazing fiancée, Beau, and we will be getting married here in our hometown this August. Together we have one cuddly pet snake, Masa, as well as a charming Betta fish, Mr. Betta.</p>
    <p>I graduated in June 2015 from Eastern Washington University, where I spent 4 years studying technical communication, visual communication design, as well as Japanese. Writing has always been one of my passions, so studying and learning about technical communication has been a very exciting opportunity for me. </p>
      <p>During my time at EWU, I worked at the Office of Global Initiatives, the campus headquarters for all things international, and developed a passion for travel, intercultural relations, and international education.
    I’ve been to Japan twice, once for a homestay program in Yamato, and once for an intensive Japanese language study abroad program in Nagoya. I love travelling, and am hoping to visit Europe for my next travel adventure. </p>
    <p>When I’m not working or studying, I enjoy watching a good movie and playing video games with my fiancée. I also like to spend my time exercising, writing, and studying other languages. If there's anything else you'd like to know about me, feel free to send me a message through the Contact Me tab up top!</p>
